            <h3>About This Image</h3>
            <p>This GIF shows Mirai Kuriyama, a first-year high school Spirit World Warrior from the anime series 
               Beyond the Boundary (Ky≈çkai no Kanata), having her tears gently wiped by a boy. 
               Mirai is known for her red-rimmed glasses and pink cardigan, which conceals a wound on her arm 
               that allows her to manipulate her blood. The GIF captures a tender, emotional moment from the series. 
               Because it is simple with only a few movements, it can be used as a peaceful background for emotional songs, 
               creating a subtle and heartfelt atmosphere for viewers.</p>

            <h3>Why GIF Format?</h3>
            <p>The GIF format is ideal for this image because it supports animation and looping. 
               It allows this emotional moment to be seen as a short, continuous action. 
               The simple and limited movement makes it lightweight, peaceful, and effective as a background GIF. 
               This format helps evoke an emotional feeling in viewers without being distracting.</p>
