        <p>Because it guarantees equal access to information and functionality on the web, WCAG 2.2 is significant. Without appropriate accessibility measures, millions of people with disabilities around the world may find it challenging to browse websites. Websites become more inclusive and give all users a better experience by following these rules.</p>
        <p>Businesses and organizations gain from accessibility as well. </p>
        <p>Additionally, WCAG 2.2 assists designers and developers in producing content that is more organized, comprehensible, and accessible to all. Not only is accessibility a moral and legal requirement, but it's also a recommended practice for well-designed websites.</p>
