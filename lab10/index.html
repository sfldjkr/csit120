        <h2>Welcome to WCAG 2.2 Overview</h2>
        <p>The most recent set of accessibility guidelines, WCAG 2.2, aims to improve the usability of web content for individuals with disabilities. These requirements are essential to guaranteeing that all users, regardless of ability, can efficiently navigate and utilize websites.</p>
        <p>The four primary pages of this website examine the WCAG 2.2 standard: its definition, its significance, its application, and resources for additional reading. Every page has unique content that makes this standard easy to understand.</p>
        <p>Our objective is to provide educational content about WCAG 2.2 while showcasing appropriate HTML structure, CSS styling, and accessible design practices.</p>
