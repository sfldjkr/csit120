        <p>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2 is referred to as WCAG 2.2. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created this set of guidelines to improve the accessibility of web content for people with disabilities. Visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities are all covered by the guidelines.</p>
        <p>In order to guarantee that websites are observable, functional, comprehensible, and reliable, the standard offers web developers precise standards and methods to adhere to. In order to meet changing technology and accessibility requirements, WCAG 2.2 expands on earlier iterations with updates and new success criteria.</p>
        <p>These guidelines are widely recognized and serve as the basis for accessibility laws and regulations in many countries, making them an essential framework for anyone involved in web development or design.</p>
