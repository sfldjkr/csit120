        <p>Web developers, designers, and organizations use WCAG 2.2 to make digital content accessible. Developers might, for instance, enable keyboard navigation for interactive elements, guarantee adequate color contrast, add captions for videos, and add descriptive alt text to images. People with visual, auditory, or motor impairments can use the content thanks to these techniques.</p>
        <p>When creating websites that comply with accessibility standards, government organizations, academic institutions, and private businesses frequently consult WCAG 2.2. These rules are a useful tool for ethical and legal web development since many nations have laws requiring adherence to them.</p>
        <p>WCAG 2.2 success criteria are also used by browser extensions and accessibility evaluation tools to automatically assess websites. This makes it possible for developers to find and address problems, guaranteeing that the website satisfies global accessibility requirements and improves user experience for all users.</p>
