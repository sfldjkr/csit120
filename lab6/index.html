      <h2>Target Audience</h2>
      <p>The MSSU website targets prospective students, current students, faculty and staff, parents/families, and alumni. Quicklinks address these groups with access to Lionet, Calendar, Course Catalog, Email, Blackboard, News, Giving, and Library.</p>

      <h2>Site Organization</h2>
      <p>The site uses a top navigation bar with main sections including About Us, Academics, Admissions, Financial Aid, Campus Life, and Resources. Each section contains subpages with detailed information. Academics lists all programs, including Associate’s, Bachelor’s, Graduate programs, and Certificates. The homepage highlights news, events, and important announcements.</p>
      <p>This organization helps users locate information quickly, though some sections have many links that may slow first-time users or keyboard navigation users.</p>

      <h2>CRAP Design Principle</h2>
      <p>The website demonstrates <strong>Contrast</strong> through white navigation links on a dark green background, making the menu items readable. Headings and subheadings use larger font sizes and bold formatting to clearly separate sections of content, helping users scan the site efficiently.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility Audit Score</h2>
      <p>The MSSU website received an accessibility score of <strong>65</strong>. Key issues include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Landmarks should have a unique role or role/label/title combination (1 element)</li>
        <li>Ensure all page content is contained by landmarks (1 element)</li>
        <li>Ensure buttons have accessible names (1 element)</li>
        <li>Ensure the page contains at least one level-one heading (1 element)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These issues may prevent screen reader users and keyboard users from navigating efficiently, highlighting areas for improvement.</p>

      <h2>Effectiveness</h2>
      <p>The website supports users in completing tasks accurately. Prospective students can find admissions and program information, while current students can access resources like Lionet and Blackboard. Clear labeling reduces errors, but missing accessibility features may hinder screen reader users.</p>

      <h2>Efficiency</h2>
      <p>Users can perform tasks quickly due to consistent navigation menus and logical content grouping. However, long dropdowns and dense link lists may slow first-time users or keyboard-only users slightly.</p>

      <h2>Engagement</h2>
      <p>The website is visually engaging and professional. The green and white color scheme, clean layout, and campus images provide a positive experience. Interactive elements like calendars and social media links are user-friendly. Some low-contrast icons or missing alt text may reduce engagement for users with visual impairments.</p>

      <h2>Recommendation for Improvement</h2>
      <p>To improve accessibility and user experience: landmarks should have unique roles or labels, buttons should include descriptive names, and all images should have meaningful alt text. Simplifying dropdown menus can enhance efficiency and usability for all users, including those relying on assistive technologies.</p>
