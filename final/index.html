            <p>
                Bean & Bloom Café is more than just a place for coffee—it's a home for quiet thinkers,  
                late-night dreamers, early-morning workers, and everyone searching for a warm, peaceful space  
                to recharge. We roast our beans in-house, bake our pastries fresh every morning, and  
                source all ingredients sustainably with care for our community and the planet.

            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                The roots of Bean & Bloom begin decades ago with my grandfather, who ran a small tea stall  
                on a dusty corner of the old neighborhood. It wasn’t fancy—just a wooden counter, a kettle,  
                and a few mismatched cups. But people said it was the place “where fights ended.”  
                Friends who had an argument would meet there, share tea, talk it out, and leave laughing again.  
            </p>

            <p>
                Those walls saw apologies whispered, friendships rekindled, and strangers becoming family.  
                My grandfather believed that warm drinks could heal cold hearts.  
                Today, Bean & Bloom carries that same spirit: a space built on kindness, connection,  
                and the belief that every cup can bring people a little closer.
