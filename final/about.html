        <h2>Why Supporting Small Businesses Matters</h2>
        <p>
            Small businesses like ours are the heart of local communities. They create jobs, support 
            local suppliers, and offer personal experiences that big chains cannot.  
            As explained in

               this article about the challenges small businesses face
            </a>,
            many independent shops struggle due to rising costs and corporate competition.  
            Every visit, every cup of coffee, and every friendly conversation helps keep community spaces 
            like ours alive.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>It was rewarding and challenging to work on this final website project.  Making all four pages appear to be a part of a single, polished website was one of the hardest things I had to do.  It took more planning than I anticipated to maintain the same color scheme, navigation style, and layout on every page.  Additionally, I had trouble making the website responsive.  It taught me how intricate front-end development can be, and using media queries and modifying layouts for desktop and mobile screens required trial and error.</p>
    <p>I discovered the value of appropriate HTML structure and well-organized CSS during this process.  I made my pages easier to read and navigate by using semantic tags like header, nav, main, section, and footer.  Additionally, I grew more at ease using tables, CSS layout design, hover effects for navigation, and background image styling while maintaining legible text.  I learned how to write cleaner, more accurate code by running my code through the W3C validators, which also helped me understand how minor mistakes can impact an entire page.
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite the struggles, what I enjoyed most was seeing the website come together from a blank screen to a finished project. Using the client’s logo and color palette made the design feel more real, and watching everything work smoothly—especially on my phone—was genuinely satisfying. Publishing the site on GitHub Pages made the experience feel like completing a real client job, and it gave me confidence in my web development skills moving forward.
