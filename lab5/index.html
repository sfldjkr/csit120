      <h2>Reflections</h2>
      <p><strong>Lab 02 Reflection:</strong>  
        I learned how crucial it is to organize a webpage with purpose and clarity.  
        HTML acts as the framework that gives structure to a page, ensuring information is presented in a logical and accessible way.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Lab 03 Reflection:</strong>  
        I discovered how CSS adds the personality and design that make content engaging.  
        Minor details, such as consistent spacing, font choices, and color schemes, 
        significantly improve user experience.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Lab 05 Reflection (Best Design Practices):</strong>  
        I learned that the best designs are both functional and simple. 
        Keeping layouts clean, readable, and responsive ensures accessibility for all users. 
        Itâ€™s better to focus on clarity and usability than to overload a page with design elements.
