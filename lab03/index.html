      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        From lab02, I learned how to structure an HTML page using semantic tags like 
        <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>. 
        I also practiced using lists, links, and organizing content into multiple articles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since lab02, I have gained more confidence in separating content from design by using an external 
        CSS file. I also learned how small details like font choice, spacing, and colors can make a page 
        look more professional and easier to read. This has helped me appreciate the importance of both 
        structure and style in web design.
