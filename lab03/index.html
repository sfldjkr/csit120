        I explored how lists and links can improve readability and navigation.

      <h2>Adding Style with CSS</h2>
      <p><em>Published on September 18, 2025 by Safal Shrestha</em></p>
      <p>
        I learned how to separate content from design using external CSS. 
        Styling with fonts, colors, and spacing made my webpages 
        look more professional and visually appealing.

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
       I learned from these labs how crucial it is to organize a webpage with purpose and clarity.  While CSS adds the personality and design that make content engaging, HTML serves as the framework.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finding out how minor details, such as consistent spacing, appropriate tag selection, and well-designed navigation, significantly impact user experience was what I valued most.  I am now more assured of my ability to create and design webpages, and I am eager to learn more sophisticated features in the future.
