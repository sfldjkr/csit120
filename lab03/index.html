      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p><strong>Lab 02 Reflection:</strong>  
        I learned how crucial it is to organize a webpage with purpose and clarity.  
        HTML acts as the framework that gives structure to a page, ensuring information is presented in a logical and accessible way.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Lab 03 Reflection:</strong>  
        I discovered how CSS adds the personality and design that make content engaging.  
        Minor details, such as consistent spacing, font choices, and color schemes, 
        significantly improve user experience. This gave me more confidence to design webpages that look both professional and functional.
