        <h2>What is the Web Share API?</h2>
        
        <p>Web apps can share content directly with native sharing capabilities thanks to the Web Share API, a browser interface. </p>
        
        <p>Text, URLs, and files in a variety of formats are all supported by this technology.</p>
        
        <p>The proper operation of the API depends on user interaction, which is a crucial security feature. </p>
        
        <p>Strong privacy safeguards are built into the API. Websites that use this technology are unable to determine which sharing targets are accessible on a device or which option users choose in the end. By not disclosing details about installed apps or personal preferences to websites, this stops fingerprinting methods and safeguards user privacy. </p>
